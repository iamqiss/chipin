## What is StockFair?

Stokvels move over **R50 billion** through South African communities every year — mostly through WhatsApp groups, handwritten books, and trust. Banks have only captured about R12 billion of that. The rest runs on faith alone.

StockFair is a digital-first stokvel management platform that brings transparency, accountability, and collective buying power to every group — without replacing the human trust that makes stokvels work in the first place.

Built for the mamas. Built for the circles. Built for South Africa.
